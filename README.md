# Notes:
Dan: I'm a fan of Slack so I'd advocate using that. I've used Trello before but not much of a fan, if anyone has other project management software in mind I'm very open. I've started brainstorming things we'll have to do and for now I'll just put it on here as a document until we choose where to keep todo info.
