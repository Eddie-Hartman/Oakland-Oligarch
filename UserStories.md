As a player of "Oakland Oligarchy",
I would like to have currancy,
so that I can have a starting resource, a distinct win/loss condition, and clear metrics of progress

As a player of OO,
I would like to have some player customizability,
so that I can identify my pieces by name and color.

As a player of OO,
I would like to save and load my game,
so that I can pause and come back at another time to finish my match.

As a player of OO,
I would like to have tradable, sellable, buyable properties
so that I can own spaces of the board and acquire more currancy.

As a customer of OO,
I would like to have a "jail",
so that players can be penalized at random and thus forcibly equalizing players

As a customer of OO,
I would like the board to have 36 squares in a square with 10 squares per side and a minimum of 4 properties,
so that Players have spaces to move around the board in and properties to buy and sell.

As a player of OO,
I would like the starting player, the rolls on each turn, and any action cards to be random,
so that the game is approximately fair based upon these simple mechanics.

As a player of OO,
I would like to be able to read the rules of the game,
so that I can learn to play and understand the game interface fully.
